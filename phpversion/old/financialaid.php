<p style="width:68%;">A shared meal plan is the combination of a "Block 95" meal plan (the minimum required University meal plan for juniors and seniors who choose to live in a four-year residential college), and an eating club membership. It enables upperclass students who reside in a four-year residential college to eat their meals in both their residential college and their eating club. Students who elect a shared meal plan pay an amount equal to the membership fee (not including the social fee) of their particular club. This fee is covered by financial aid packages.
Rising juniors and seniors who belong to an eating club and who want to live in a four-year residential college have the opportunity to choose one of their club's available shared meal plans for their 2008-2009 academic year during room draw in the spring of 2008. Each club has established a maximum number of shared meal plans available each academic year for their junior and senior members. Club members are encouraged to ask their club leadership for specific information regarding shared meal plans at their club.</p>
<p>All upperclass students interested in choosing a shared meal plan must submit an application for the residential college draw. Using a computer lottery, the room draw process determines the order in which students can select available rooms, and thus available shared meal plans. During the residential college room draw, a club member who is interested in a shared meal plan will be able to select from the shared meal plans that are available at their particular club during their draw time. The room draw system will allow students the option to select a shared meal plan for their club so long as the maximum number of shared meal plans set by their club has not yet been reached. Once a particular club's maximum is reached, the option to participate in a shared meal plan will no longer be available to any subsequent members of that club in the residential college room selection process. </p>
<p>Any remaining members of that club could choose to remove themselves from the residential college room draw and enter the regular upperclass room selection with a full club meal plan, or they could choose to live in the residential college and purchase at least the required 95 meal plan for their residential college in addition to their full club meal plan. In this case, the student would hold (and pay for) two separate meal plans, not a shared meal plan. Upperclass students with questions about selecting a shared meal plan during their draw time are encouraged to contact Angie Hodgeman, Manager for Undergraduate Housing at hodgeman@princeton.edu or 8-3461.</p>
