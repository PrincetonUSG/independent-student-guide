<p>The Independent Student Guide is Princeton's online resource for independent underclassmen. Each year, approximately 350 students elect to go independent rather than joining an eating club or staying in a residential college. While an exciting option, independent means that you will have to fend for yourself on the food front. These pages have been designed to help you through that process. Whether you're looking for the bus route to Whole Foods or quick, healthy recipe ideas, the Independent Student Guide is your number one reference. Enjoy!</p>
