<p><h1>So you<br />want to go<br />independent!</h1> Your first step will be to enter the <strong>independent housing draw</strong>. You can choose to go solo or join together with friends to live and cook together. Think carefully about the kind of independent experience you want.</p>
<p>Are you looking to have your own kitchen and bathroom with three roommates? Would you prefer a single near a shared kitchen? Or maybe you don't want to have to cook every day and would rather cook once or twice a week in a coop setting? 
<p>There are actually three different independent draws: the Spelman Draw, the 2-Dickinson Coop Draw and the general Independent Draw (which also applies to Brown Coop members). Once you know more about what you'll want, you can read more about each kind of draw and the draw process in the <a href="roomdraw.php">Independent Room Draw</a> section.</p>
