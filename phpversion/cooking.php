<p><p><h1>Cookware</h1>Cookware is essential to independent life, especially in non-coop settings. </p>
<ul>
<li>A good bet is to buy cookware from graduating independents, who will probably give you a deal. Check out <a href="https://point.princeton.edu/tigertrade/">TigerTrade</a> for listings or ask around with seniors you know.</li>
<li>For used cookware at low prices, check out the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&dq=red+white+and+blue+loc:+Trenton,+NJ&daddr=2055+Nottingham+Way,+Mercerville,+NJ+08619&geocode=6906554034438889607,40.233085,-74.708374&ll=40.233085,-74.708374&iwstate1=dir:to&iwloc=A&f=d">Red White & Blue Thrift Store in Trenton</a>.</li>
<li>If you want everything in one go, you may want something like <a href="http://www.target.com/Chefmate-51-pc-Kitchen-Box-Set/dp/B0014GRTBW/sr=1-1/qid=1216221703/ref=sr_1_1/601-8805467-6480156?ie=UTF8&index=target&rh=k%3Akitchen in a box&page=1">Target's Kitchen in a Box set</a>.</li>
<li>At the very least, you'll want to have: a frying pan, small pot, large pot, at least one good knife, can opener, some plates, cups and silverware. </li>
</ul>
<p>Once you get started, you'll know if there are different types of cookware you'll need for your recipes.  You may also want to think about a microwave or toaster/toaster oven if you are not using a shared kitchen.  </p>
