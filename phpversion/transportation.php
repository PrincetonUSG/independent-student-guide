<h1>Buses</h1>
Princeton Students do not need a vehicle to take advantage of the surrounding areas in New Jersey. The New Jersey Transit bus system steadily picks people up just outside of Princeton's gates. The following chart shows some of the destinations each bus serves:

<p>Services for the 605 and 606 bus are provided by <a href="http://www.njtransit.com">New Jersey Transit</a>. The full schedules are available as pdfs for the <a href="http://www.njtransit.com/pdf/bus/T0605.pdf">605 bus</a> and the <a href="http://www.njtransit.com/pdf/bus/T0606.pdf">606 bus.</a></p>
<p>The 605 bus stops both in front of the Dinky, on Witherspoon near the Public Library, and across from Palmer Square. If you're not sure you're at the right stop, ask the driver before you get on the bus.</p> 
<p>Princeton also contracts a bus to make trips to Whole Foods each spring. Look for the schedules in Frist.</p>
