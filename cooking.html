<p><p><h1>Cookware</h1>Cookware is essential to independent life, especially in non-coop settings. </p>

<ul>

<li>A good bet is to buy cookware from graduating independents, who will probably give you a deal. Alternately, you can find cheap gear at <a href="http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/category/college/kitchen-dining/cookware-bakeware/12507/">Bed Bath and Beyond</a>, Target, or Walmart.</li>


<li>For used cookware at low prices, check out the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&dq=red+white+and+blue+loc:+Trenton,+NJ&daddr=2055+Nottingham+Way,+Mercerville,+NJ+08619&geocode=6906554034438889607,40.233085,-74.708374&ll=40.233085,-74.708374&iwstate1=dir:to&iwloc=A&f=d" target="_blank">Red White & Blue Thrift Store in Trenton</a>.</li>

<li>If you want everything in one go, you may want something like <a href="http://www.target.com/Chefmate-51-pc-Kitchen-Box-Set/dp/B0014GRTBW/sr=1-1/qid=1216221703/ref=sr_1_1/601-8805467-6480156?ie=UTF8&index=target&rh=k%3Akitchen in a box&page=1" target="_blank">Target's Kitchen in a Box set</a>.</li>

<li>At the very least, you'll want to have: a frying pan, small pot, large pot, at least one good knife, can opener, some plates, cups and silverware. </li>

</ul>

<p>Once you get started, you'll know if there are different types of cookware you'll need for your recipes.  You may also want to think about a microwave or toaster/toaster oven if you are not using a shared kitchen.  </p>

<p><h1>Healthy<br />Eating</h1>

One of the greatest parts about going independent is having the freedom to choose what you eat. Just remember to make it healthy! Below are some websites to help you figure out how.</p>


<p>Remember learning about the food pyramid in first grade?<a href="http://www.choosemyplate.gov"> This site</a> introduces you to the new and improved pyramid (now a plate) and also has a menu planner to help you develop balanced meals based on your recommended caloric intake.</p>
