<p><h1 style="float:none;">2 Dickinson Street Co-op</h1></p>

<p>2 Dickinson Street (2D) is an organized independent dining option open to all. Members pay just $500 per semester, and cook dinner once a week with other members (no cooking experience necessary). Members can come any time of the day or night to use the co-op kitchen and enjoy leftovers, fruit, cheese, yogurt, milk, and juice from the co-op fridges and freezers or cereal, fresh bread, and sandwich fillings such as hummus, jam, and almond butter from the well-stocked pantry. Fresh-cooked dinner is served every evening. Recent meals have included mushroom risotto, fondue, vegetable sushi, avacado salad, cookies, curries, Dal, stir-fries, and much more. The kitchen is 100% vegetarian, though not everyone in 2D is vegetarian, and vegan options are available at every meal. Guests interested in the co-op are welcome to visit for dinner any day at 6:30pm. Make sure to check out <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~twod"target="_blank">2D's website</a>.</p>

<p><h1 style="float:none;">International Food Co-op</h1></p>

<p> The International Food Co-op (IFC) began in 2009 as in alternative eating option for those interested in enjoying creative international cuisine. As its name suggests, this co-op will feature food from all parts of the world, cooked and enjoyed by its members in a friendly and familial atmosphere.</p>

<p>Members cook once a week with three other members, and so those who join will learn to cook cuisines from many different countries, and in the company of other food aficionados. In addition, the IFCwill have traditions and events that celebrate the holidays of cultures across the globe.</p>

<p>IFC members may draw into and live in any building on campus, including Spelman. (For Spelman, members must draw as upperclassmen and not independent.) The IFC is located in Entryway 4 of Laughlin.</p> 

<p>Membership is only $400 a semester. For more information, email the IFC at at <a href="mailto:ifc@princeton.edu">ifc@princeton.edu</a>.</p>
