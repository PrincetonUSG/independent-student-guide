<p>If the eating clubs aren't for you...</p>
<p>But, you're not sure you want to cook every night</p>
<p>Don't sweat!</p>
<p>Princeton has a new option: <b>The Upperclass Dining Initiative</b></p>
<p>A long needed option, the Upperclass Dining Initiative allows you to remain on the meal plan or go to a Points-only plan so that you can eat healthy food and interact with a diverse group of other upperclass students.</p>
<p>Though you may eat in any dining hall, Dining Services has graciously agreed to redesign the rear of Rocky Dining Hall to create a junior/senior lounge, complete with couches, rugs, end tables, and even coffee machines &ndash; your friends will want to meal exchange with you all the time! It will be a great place to chat with fellow students, meet for study groups, or just hang out.</p>
<p>The Upperclass Dining Initiative is also committed to providing some great <em>social opportunities</em>. These will include intramural teams, trips into New York City and Philadelphia to see shows, barbeques, study breaks, DJ events with other campus organizations, and more!</p>
<p>The more people who sign up, the more successful the plan will be. This means more friendly faces at dinner. (So get your friends to join.) Plus, you will still have <em>Late Meals</em> and Dining Services Special Dinners &ndash; always great things.</p>
<p>But, what if you want to cook sometimes? That's fine: You would <em>not</em> have to be on a 14 or 20 meal a week plan &ndash; Maybe 6, 7, or 11 is better so you could cook on the weekends.</p>
