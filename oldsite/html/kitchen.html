</table>
<p>Keys to locked cabinets are available for the Edwards, Little, Patton (basement), Scully (1st fl) and 1903 kitchens. Independent students who wish to have use of a cabinet in any of these kitchens may sign up at the time of the Independent Draw. These cabinet keys will be available at check-in. Cabinet spaces remaining open in these kitchens after the Independent Draw, are available to any student on a first-come, first-served basis through May 1. After this date, students may not sign up for cabinet keys until after the start of classes in September.</p>
<p>Because of size, the Cuyler kitchen is intended to be a snack kitchen only; therefore, there are no Cuyler rooms in the Independent Draw. Kitchens in the residential colleges are intended for use by residential college members only.</p>
<h2>Locked Kitchens</h2>
<p>Limited access kitchens are located in Pyne and 1901/Laughlin. The limited access kitchens are locked and accessible only to students who pay a fee and obtain kitchen keys from the Housing Office. Key holders pay $50.00 per academic year to underwrite initial costs, future renovations, repairs and cleaning charges. Refunds are given on a semester basis only ($25.00) to students leaving the University.</p>
<p>Independent students who wish to participate may sign up for either locked kitchen at the time of the Independent/Co-op Draws. These kitchen keys will be available at check-in. The Pyne kitchen is limited to 25 members and 1901/Laughlin to 23. Spaces remaining open in the kitchens after the Independent/Co-op Room Draws are available to any student on a first-come, first-served basis through May 1. After this date, students may not sign up for a kitchen until the first day of classes in September.</p>
<p>The following items are available in each limited access facility: tables and chairs, a full size refrigerator, a range, a toaster and a microwave oven. Students may store and use kitchen appliances brought from home, provided appliances are kept clean and in good working condition. Be cautioned that all heat producing appliances are strictly prohibited in student rooms. Limited access kitchens are randomly inspected to ensure the maintenance of fire safety codes.</p>
<p>Key holders are cooperatively responsible for cleaning their respective kitchens. Kitchen members should therefore be prepared to take part in a weekly cleaning schedule in addition to routine clean up after individual use of the kitchen area and utensils. Building Services will provide brooms, mops, garbage bags and some cleaning fluids but does not assist in the actual upkeep of limited access kitchens.</p>
