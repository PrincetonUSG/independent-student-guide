<h1>INDEPENDENT DRAW OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The University defines an independent student as one who holds no meal contract whatsoever with a University dining facility or with an off-campus club.</p>

If you apply but do not select/draw a room in any of these draws and wish to participate in Regular Draw, you must submit the <!--a href="http://fac-web-server.princeton.edu/housing/a_undergraduate/drawguide/forms/Application_Upperclass.pdf" -->Upperclass and Residential College Draw Application<!--/a--> form at the appropriate time (weighted rating points for these draws do not carry over to Regular Upperclass Draw).</p>
<p>Groups of eight or fewer may enter the Independent Draw, but at least one half of the members of any group must be independent.</p>
