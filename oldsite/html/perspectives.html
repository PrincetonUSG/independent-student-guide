<h2>The Brown Co-op</h2>
<h3>Jia Wern Ong, '03</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Brown co-op is one of the best things to happen to me at Princeton. For someone like me who felt so shy and oppressed by the dining halls, the cozy environment was just what I needed.... not too many people to deal with (phew!)</li><li>You can eat anything you want at anytime!!! Yaay!</li>
<li>You get to cook! and cook anything you want!!! I get to eat lots of rice and chinese food... yumm....</li>
<li>the people the people... what is food without company? it has been good.... mostly good :-).</li>

<h2>Scully</h2>
<h3>Keisha White, '04</h3>
<p>My independent experience is not the usual one.  Since I am a student manager for Dining Services I am entitled to free meals, but I do not have a meal plan.  Unfortunately I did not take enough advantage of this option.  This option did ensure that when I was broke I could still eat.</p>
<p>Even though I am independent I did not participate in independent draw after failing to gain a room in Spelman.  One of my roommates was in a club and did not enter independent draw.  We looked for rooms that were close to a kitchen and laundry and Scully was the best choice.  My room, 272 Scully, is above the kitchen, next to the laundry room and under the study room.  The room's location also facilitates working at the Butler/Wilson Dining Hall.</p>
<p>I am independent for economic and social reasons.  As a student on financial aid I cannot afford the $5000 to join an eating club.  I do not have the excuse of needing meals because I work for the dining hall.  A part of the money for the eating club is a social fee for parties and events.  I am not a party person so it would have been uneconomical to pay for parties I would rarely attend. I do not work on average 15 hours a week at 2 jobs to pay for parties I will not attend and eat meals I could eat at the Dining Hall for free. On a social level, my closest friends at Princeton are not a part of the eating club scene so my social life is not hampered by not being in a club.</p>
<p>My independent experience was more expensive than I planned.  When I had a meal plan I could eat at Frist using late meals and points, this semester I had to charge.  This is leaving me with a charge bill of a couple hundred dollars but it is still cheaper than taking out loans to pay for an eating club.  I ate almost every meal at Frist over the year because cooking in Scully was impractical.  The full kitchen in Scully is poorly designed and over used.  Because it is an open kitchen many of the students who use it do not clean up after themselves.  The fridge, cooking and counter areas are always filthy.  The trashcans are always overflowing, causing some students to leave garbage on the ground.  Since we were not using the standard size fridge in the kitchen we could not buy food in bulk.  It did not help that some person was also stealing cooking equipment and food from the kitchen.</p>
<p>Despite the unplanned for events I would recommend independent living for anyone as long as they know all the facts before hand.  I believe that independent living is more suited for some personality types than others.  Thanks to the money I saved from canceling my dining contract I did not have to pay Princeton during the school year like I did the year before.  Despite not being in a club or residential college and 2 junior papers I strengthened my friendships, had more fun this year than the last two combined and stayed in the black for most of the year.  I like to complain but this year I do not have any real problems t o complain about.  I enjoyed my year as an Independent and I hope my year in Spelman 2003-2004 will be better.</p>

<h2>Independent Kitchen</h2>
<h3></h3>
<p>I lived in an independent kitchen my junior year, with my friends who were all in clubs.  I used the Laughlin kitchen though I lived in Foulke, which meant walking across the quad with my food in rain, snow, sun, or sleet.  Not the greatest setup, but most independent rooms are nearer to the kitchen.  It was cool that I could lock up my food in a cabinet, but in terms of communal the public space was pretty bad.</p>
<p>After the first few months, people began threatening to close the kitchen if it wasn t cleaned once in a while.  Aside from sweeping and mopping, in other cleaning was done by the users themselves.  And most people here at Princeton sadly do not know how to clean after themselves.  However, it was still liveable except in high stress times.  Sponges, utensils, and salt, pepper, and oil were always in high demand.  Your stuff was safe in the fridge, most of the time.  One time, some took out all of my hot pockets and then put the empty container back in the freezer, empty warm up tray and all.  But that was just one asshole.</p>
<p>Overall, the kitchen was pretty good.  I even made friends with some of the people that used it fairly regularly.  There was a tv, a nice sofa   other people couldn t get  it.  Most people were willing to watch your boiling water   the baking cookie smell would always upset the other people in the building.  I would say the only problems were dirt and dirt.</p>
<p>If you are going to use an independent kitchen, try to do it with a friend   you can save on cooking stuff, and eat together.  Eating alone sucks.  Eating alone with the tv on in the basement of Laughlin sucks more.  You can even study in the kitchen, late at night, because only you and twenty other people have keys.</p>

<h2>Tips and Suggestions for Independent Students</h2>
<ol>
<li>There are tons of events and talks every week that offer free meals, and are also really interesting to go to as they often cover topics that you might not otherwise have a chance to explore.  Find out about these lunches and dinners by subscribing to a lot of weekly online events newsletters (such as the Women's Center, International Center, and other student organizations) and keeping an eye out for flyers in Frist.</li>
<li>Individual departments also often sponsor lunch lectures that are open to the public.  For example, the Visual Arts department often hosts guest artists giving slide presentations of their work.  Lunch is served.</li>
<li>If you have independent roommates and friends, you can save money by sharing some ingredients.  Spices, especially, are relatively expensive and nearly impossible to finish in only a year by only one person.  Other good things to share are cheap perishables like milk and eggs.  Sugar and flour as well are good things to have and share that aren t depleted very quickly unless you bake often.</li>
<li>Meals like chili and vegetable soup are cheaper to make when you make big pots of them, and are often better as leftovers than they are the first night.  Make a big pot of something on the weekend, and eat it for the rest of the week.  (Chili leftovers can be eaten lots of ways so you don t get bored, like in sandwiches with cheese or in tortillas.)</li>
<li>Get membership cards at all stores you go to (Wegman's, McCaffrey's, CVS)! These are free, allow you to take advantage of their sales and it only takes five minutes to fill out the form.  When you go shopping, look for sales and take advantage of them.</li>
<li>If you don t have a car but have a bike, McCaffrey's is surprisingly close, and you can pack your groceries in a backpack.</li>

<li>You can buy good quality dishes and pots and pans that just need a good cleaning from Red White and Blue, a thrift store at 2055 Nottingham Way, Trenton (phone 609-586-1608).</li>
<li>If you like cereal for breakfast, Walmart has some of the cheapest cereal available (or look for sales at McCaffrey's or other grocery stores).  The U-Store has the most expensive cereal in the country.</li>
<li>If you are going to live in Spelman, buy lots of appliances and pots and pans and utensils from graduating seniors.  They re going to have lots of other stuff you could probably use too, like cutting boards.  If this fails, go to Target or Walmart and buy the "kitchen in a box" feature.  It is the coolest thing you've ever seen.</li>
<li>The only food items you need to have consistently on hand in order to survive and make different things (besides the essentials) are potatoes and chicken broth.  Potatoes make eighteen different items for each of the three meals.  Chicken broth means soup or sauce, you decide.  Combine the two, and you're in heaven.</li>
<li>Save easy mac, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and frozen dinners for special (not too often) occasions.  Trust me, these are the old faithfuls for exam week.</li>
<li>Use your dinner leftovers as lunch for the next day.  Smart, no?</li>
<li>If you have different eating habits from your roommates, you may want to own your own fridge.  That way, you can keep the good stuff you like to eat separate from those vultures.</li>
<li>Buy the Sam's Club card and buy things in bulk.  Serious savings!</li>
<li>Buy the grocery store brand versions of different foods and save.</li>
<li>There is a rumor that Panera gives out its day old bread at the end of the night.</li>
<li>Borrow someone else's grill to cook some days.</li>
<li>Always add things to ready made soup, like cheese, spices, or broccoli: it makes it better!</li>
<li>Cheese goes on everything.</li>
