<h1>The Independent Student Guide</h1>
<p>For the purposes of this guide, an "Independent Student" is any Princeton student who is:</p>
<p>1. a junior or senior and not affiliated with an eating club<br />or<br />2. looking to eat or cook independently of the University system</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> this is <em>not</em> the Housing Department's definition of an "independent student" -- see: <a href="http://facilities.princeton.edu/housing/a_undergraduate/drawguide/ucdraws.html#independent">Independent Draw Options</a> (on the Housing Department's Room Draw Guide).</p>
<p>The Independent Student Guide was compiled to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assist with the many challenges and adjustments faced by all Independent Students</li>
<li>Provide all students with a multitude of useful information about living in Princeton</li>
<li>Help students considering going independent make informed decisions</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope this guide has accomplished all these goals and more! Please frequently take advantage of the services offered on this page.</p>
